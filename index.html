                        <li>Added margin to the posts on posts.html, based on feedback</li>
                        <li>Had forgotten to add smooth scroll, so added this. Mostly needed for the "to top" button.</li>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Changed bg-image on index.htm, looks/works better. Also added a an overlay-color to darken the image to achieve correct contrast with the text. This way I did not need the bg-color behind H3 on index. Also adjusted the size of headings both on index.html, and some of the other pages, some of it because of the new font, and some of them needed to be a bit smaller.</li>
                        <li>Changed to a more modern font, based on feedback. I found some fonts that may have worked better, but they were not available for free.</li>
                        <li>Adjusted layout on "latest news", on index.html. It now goes to row, instead of column, earlier. This way the content is more visible/available for the user on larger screens</li>
                        <li>Made the burger menu more user-friendly. It covers the screen, and has lines between menu items. Easier to look at and use. Changed the color to blue</li>
                        <li>Deleted images and files that was not in use from image folder</li>
                        <li>Changed the "active" styling for main nav. blue color and underline. More in line with the design/colors.</li>
                        <li>Adjusted the size of the logo and the nav so it does not take up to much space/focus. Just enough to look good/clean.</li>
                        <li>Changed top bg-image on explore, visit and about.html. Also changed the bg-image on contact.html, and added the same color overlay as on index.html using position and z-index. The new image brings the design more togheter.</li>
                        <li>Changed width of H3 on explore.html. Looks better, and does not wrap underneath as it did before on some of the sections</li>
                        <li>Instead of bg-color behind the text on images in exhibitions, I added a bg-color overlay to darken the images to achieve good contrast. In my oppinion it looks more neat.</li>
                        <li>Adjusted some of the img sizes and text on explore.html. Made the paragraphs a bit bigger on the larger screens, so it is easier to read.</li>
                        <li>Added smooth scroll, so that the buttons now take the user smoothly around when used.</li>
                        <li>Corrected the mistake of using anchor tags inside of list items several places</li>
                        <li>Changed a bit on the layout on about.html. Used float on some of the images, just makes it look less generic.</li>
                        <li>Adjusted the index CTAs to be a bit smaller on the smaller screens so they don`t take up too much focus.</li>
                        <li>Tried to clean up the CSS where I could/and noticed things. Got rid of many unused selectors, and repeated styling</li>

                        <li>Mainly worked on responsiveness, based on feedback, and the fact that it lacked responsiveness. Did not have the time to finish it all, but it looks much better.</li>
                        <li>Reduced the number of css files and html files, combining styling and layout so the site looks more consistent.</li>
                        <li>Used the JS to fetch the movies for the other pages aswell(pay per view categories, favourites, purchases etc.)</li>
                        <li>Added dropdown options button for smaller screens on the movie pages. Makes it a lot more responsive and user-friendly</li>
                        <li>Changed the layout/styling on burger-menu. Also fixed it so it now works as it should. This was not the case before.</li>
                        <li>Corrected wrong placing of anchor tags in some places/navigations.</li>
                        <li>Changed many of the href links, but there may be some still not fixed</li>
                        <li>Combined the pages for producers to one single page, where the user can scroll through, or use the links. Changed the color to green, like the green is also used on index.html. Did not finish all the responsiveness for this page.</li>
                        <li>Did not get to work on spesific-movie.html.</li>
                        <li>Got rid of some of the shadow behind elements, and some of the borders. It makes a cleaner design.</li>
                        <li>The members-page is reduced to a more simple layout. The account info is on the members page, and then the user clicks to go to purchases or favorites, which now looks like the other movie pages. From there the user can choose to browse other movies too</li>
                        <li>Did not have time to work on the footer</li>
                        <li>Corrected and changed the CSS where appropriate, and where I found "mistakes" based on the DRY-principle. Overall I reduced the CSS files by a few and the same with the html files</li>
